# Robotic-Elbow
A multi-angle robotic elbow joint designed for adaptable articulation and precise motion control in modular robotic arms.

## Project Overview
This project presents a modular robotic elbow joint designed and modeled using Onshape. The objective was to create a multi-angle articulating component suitable for robotic arm assemblies with precise motion control and flexible integration.

## Design Platform
- **Software Used:** Onshape (Cloud-based CAD)
- **Design Type:** Assembly with Part Studios
- **CAD Approach:** Parametric modeling with cylindrical and planar mates

## Key Features
- Multi-axis rotation allowing versatile motion
- Customizable link lengths for variable arm configurations
- Compact and lightweight geometry suitable for both simulation and real-world applications

## Applications
- Robotic manipulators
- Sensor mounts
- Educational or research-focused robotic prototypes

## Technical Highlights
- Mated using **Revolute**, **Planar**, and **Slider** constraints
- Optimized joint clearance to prevent interference
- Scalable geometry for integration into larger assemblies

## Design Goals
- Achieve maximum flexibility in articulation
- Maintain structural stability under simulated loads
- Enable future motorized or servo-controlled motion

## File Structure
- `PartStudio_ElbowLink`: base links and connection shaft
- `Assembly_RoboticElbow`: complete joint with applied mates
- `Drawings/`: includes 2D sketches and exploded view references

## Designer
- **Name:** Majd Bagazi
- **Background:** Computer Engineering  
- **COOP Focus:** Integration of mechanical design into control systems and automation
